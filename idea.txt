read buffer if no static buffer
if static buffer, read that buffer, starting from the position of static void pointer to last newline
replace all \n in buffer with \0
copy buffer to mega buffer, stopping at \0 (strcpy)
if strcpy return < BUFFER_SIZE, a newline has been found;
	set static void pointer or something to the position of that newline, return 1
else read next buffer
repeat
