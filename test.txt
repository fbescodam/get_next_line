42 is a private, nonprofit and tuition-free computer programming school created and funded by French billionaire Xavier Niel (founder of the telecommunication company Illiad) with several partners including Nicolas Sadirac (previous director-general of the Epitech school in France),[1] Kwame Yamgnane and Florian Bucher (former executives of Epitech).[2]
The school was first opened in Paris in 2013.

Out of more than 80,000 candidates in France, 3,000[3] were selected to complete a four-week intensive computer programming bootcamp called piscine (swimming-pool).
Any person older than 18[4] can register for the piscine after completing the logical reasoning tests on the website.

The school does not have any professors, and is open 24/7.
The training is inspired by new modern ways to teach which include peer-to-peer pedagogy and project-based learning.
The School has been endorsed by many high-profile people in Silicon Valley including Evan Spiegel the co-founder and CEO of Snapchat, Keyvon Beykpour the co-founder and CEO of Periscope, Stewart Butterfield the co-founder and CEO of Slack, Brian Chesky the co-founder and CEO of Airbnb, Tony Fadell the founder and CEO of Nest Labs, Jack Dorsey the co-Founder and CEO of Twitter, Paul Graham, venture capitalist and co-Founder of Y Combinator, Bill Gurley venture capitalist and general partner at Benchmark.

All the intellectual property belongs to the students.
